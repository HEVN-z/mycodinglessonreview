#
# Escape Character
#
# To insert characters that are illegal in a string, use an escape character.
# An escape character is a blackslash \ followed by the character you want to insert.
# An example of an illegal character is a double quote inside a string that is surrounded by double quotes:

# Example
# You will get an error if you use double quotes inside a string that is surrounded by double quotes:

# txt = "We are the so-called "Vikings" from the north."
# To fix this problem, use the escape character \" :

# Example
# The escape character allows you to use doublequotes when you normally would not be allowed:
# txt = "We are the so-called \"Vikings\" from the north."
