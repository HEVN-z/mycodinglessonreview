# Python Arithmetic Operators
# Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values perform common mathematical operations:

print("x + y Addition")
print("10 + 5")
print(10 + 5)

print("x - y Substraction")
print("10 - 5")
print(10 - 5)

print("x * y Multiplication")
print("10 * 5")
print(10 * 5)

print("x / y Diviision")
print("10 / 5")
print(10 / 5)

print("x % y Modulus")
print("10 % 5")
print(10 % 5)

print("x ** y Exponentiation")
print("10 ** 5")
print(10 ** 5)

print("x // y Floor division")
print("10 // 5")
print(10 // 5)

# Python Assignment Operators
# Operator      Example     Same As
#   =           x = 5       x = 5
#   +=          x += 3      x = x + 3
#   -=          x -= 3      x = x - 3
#   *=          x *= 3      x = x * 3
#   /=          x /= 3      x = x / 3
#   %=          x %= 3      x = x % 3
#   //=         x //= 3     x = x // 3
#   **=         x **= 3     x = x ** 3
#   &=          x &= 3      x = x & 3
#   |=          x |= 3      x = x | 3
#   ^=          x ^= 3      x = x ^ 3
#   >>=         x >>= 3     x = x >> 3
#   <<=         x <<= 3     x = x << 3


# Python Comparison Operators
# Compareison operators are used to compare two value:
# Operator      Name                            Example
# ==            Equal                           x == y
# !=            Not equal                       x != y
# >             Greater than                    x > y
# <             Less than                       x < y
# >=            Greater than or equal to        x >= y
# <=            Less than or equal to           x <= y



# Python Logical Operators
# Logical Operators are used to combine conditional statements:
# Operator      Description                     Example

# and           Return True if both             x < 5 and x < 10
#               statements are true

# or            Return True if one of           x < 5 or x < 4
#               the statement is true

# not           Reverse the result, returns     not(x < 5 and x < 10)
#               False if the result is true


# Python Identity Operators
# Identity operators are used to compare the objects, not if they are equal, but if they are actually the same object, with the same memory location:
# Operator      Description                     Example

# is            Return True if both variables   x is y
#               are the same object

# is not        Return True if both variables   x is not y
#               are not the same object


# Python Membership Operators
# Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object:
# Operator      Description                     Example

# in            Return True if a sequence       x in y
#               with the specified value is
#               present in the object

# not in        Return True if a sequence       x not in y
#               with the specified value is
#               NOT present in the object
