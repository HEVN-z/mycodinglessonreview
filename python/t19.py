# List Items
# List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate value.
# List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.

# Ordered
# When we say that lists are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.
# If you add new items to a list, the new items will be placed at the end of the list.

# Changeable
# The list is changeable, meaning that we can change, add, and remove items in list after it has been created.

# Allow Duplicates
# Sinc lists are indexed, Lists can have items with the same value:

# Example
# List allow duplicate value:

thislist = ["apple","banana","cherry","apple","cherry"]
print(thislist)
